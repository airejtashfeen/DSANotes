## Binary Trees

A binary tree is one which has 0, 1, or 2 children.

### Types of Nodes

- **0 children**: Leaf node
- **1 child**: Either left child or right child, but not both
- **2 children**: Both left and right children present

### Types of Binary Trees

#### Full Binary Tree

Every node has either 0 or 2 children.

#### Complete Binary Tree

All levels are completely filled, except (possibly) for the last level.

The last level has all nodes filled from left to right, which means it can't have a node skipped from left.

#### Perfect Binary Tree

All leaf nodes are at the same level.
